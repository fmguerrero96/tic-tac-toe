# tic-tac-toe
This is my rendition of The Odin Project's TicTacToe project assignment.
I did not follow their instructions exacly due to the fact that I ran into some complications with my computer. Then I just
decided to submit the project as it is. I did not feel like spending more time with this project because I wanted to move on 
to the next lessons. 
One of the main objectives of the project was to use as little global code as possible. They suggest you try tucking everything away inside of a module or factory, which I did.
